# Sourdough starter

## Ingredients
- Flour â€” Whole wheat is preferred, organic is preferred, conventional all purpose white will work just fine
- Water

## Equipment
- A mason jar
- Cheesecloth or similar

## Steps

1. Day 1: Put 100g of flour and 100g of water in the mason jar, stir to combine, let sit uncovered for a day
2. Day 2: Dump out most (but not all, leave about 10%) of the goop. Add 100g flour and 100g water. Let sit uncovered (or covered, doesn't matter too much) for another day.
3. Day 3-? (see notes): Dump out most (but not all, leave about 10%) of the goop. Add 100g flour and 100g water.
4. You can continue to feed every day, or once it's really alive you can pop it into the fridge and feed less frequently (twice a week, or if you want to really push it once a week)
5. If you've been storing it in the fridge and you want to bake, pull it out 24 hours before you want to start baking and feed it again by following step 3.

## Notes

- Why a `?` in the amount of days? Well depending on your local microfauna it could be really quick, or it could take a week. What you're looking for is your goop to grow by about 2x (maybe more) after you feed it, it should take ~4 hours for it to double in size, it should smell good, bready, slightly sour. If it's really beery or alcoholic smelling it's probably too warm. If it's not doing anything by day 5 it's probably too cold. 
- There are often two "infections" the first one isn't quite as useful as the second. The first infection will die down and you may have a day where it looks like you killed it, you didn't, keep going! After a day or so you'll get the right kind of infection and it'll start being really active again.
- I haven't tried this, but apparently it works: if you want to save some as a backup in case you kill it you can take some of the stuff your about to dump out and spread it thinly over wax paper, roll up the wax paper, put it into a freezer bag and freeze it somewhat indefinitely. Just crack the frozen starter apart, put it in a new jar, and feed it as in step 3.
