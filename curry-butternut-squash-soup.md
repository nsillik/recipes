# Curried Butternut Squash Soup

## Ingredients

- 1 butternut squash: 3/4inch(ish) cubes. peeled, guts removed, seeds reserved (for toasting, yum!)
- 1 medium yellow onion: diced
- 4tbs butter (vegan: oil, coconut or vegetable, maybe, no promises)
- chicken stock (vegan: sub vegetable broth, I suppose)
- 1/4 cup Half & Half: or more, to taste (vegan: you could try coconut to make this vegan, but no promises)
- 1tbs curry powder: (see notes for spice info)
- salt & pepper: to taste
- creme fraiche for garnish (sour cream or mexican-style crema also work) (vegan: ?????)

## Equipment
- Big ol' pot
- Immersion blender (or regular blender, but good luck)

## Recipe

1. Melt butter in in big ol' pot over medium high heat until gently bubbling and smelling good.
2. Add diced onion, and cook (for about 5 minutes, or until you're bored) until transluscent stirring occasionally until translucent (avoid browning)
3. Add cubed butternut squash, and stir the best you can for a few minutes getting it buttery and covered in onions.
4. Add enough chicken broth to cover (see notes)
5. Cook for ~20 minutes at a decent simmer (try not to boil to hard) until you can easily put a fork through a butternut squash cube.
6. Add curry, salt, pepper, and other spices to taste.
7. Blend with immersion blender until smooth. Or if you don't have one: transfer to regular blender, be very careful, blend until smooth and transfer back to pot.
8. Taste, adjust spices
9. Add half & half and combine either by immersion blender or by stirring
10. Let sit for a few minutes, taste, and adjust spices again
11. Ladle into bowls, garnish with creme fraiche and serve

## Notes
- Spices: I use just a pretty standard indian curry mix, masala or similar. I also add cayenne for spice, tumeric for yellow, and paprika for red to get it a great orange colour.
- Stock amount: cover the cubes by 1/2 to 1 inch (depending on desired consistency). If your squash cubes float then just be careful to only float them by a similar amount.
