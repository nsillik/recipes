INGREDIENTS
For the eggnog:
12 large eggs yolks (reserve 8 of the whites)
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 quart (4 cups) half & half
2 cups heavy cream - set aside 1.5 cups for serving, use 1/2 in base
1 liter bourbon or irish whiskey
3/4 cup Amaretto or Frangelico
1/2 cup Myers’s dark rum
Pinch fine salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
To serve:
8 reserved egg whites
1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream
Freshly grated nutmeg

INSTRUCTIONS
Place the reserved egg whites in a very clean and airtight container and refrigerate until the eggnog is ready to serve.
For the base eggnog:
Combine the yolks and 2 cups sugar in a large bowl and whisk until well blended and creamy smooth with no visible sugar grains remaining.
Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine.
Transfer the mixture to a 1-gallon glass jar and tightly seal the lid. (Alternatively, you can bottle it.) Place in the refrigerator for 1-3 days before serving.
To serve:
When ready to serve, let the egg whites come to room temperature, and keep the heavy cream chilled. Place the egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar in the very clean bowl of a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 to 5 minutes. Remove to a large punch bowl. 
Chill a bowl for the whipped cream along with the mixer beaters. 
Place the cream  1/4 cup sugar in the stand mixer bowl (no need to wash the bowl) and whisk beaters on high speed until medium peaks form, about 1 to 4 minutes. Remove to the punch bowl. Be careful not to overwhip the cream, it can turn to butter.
Stir the eggnog base with a rubber spatula to re-combine, then add it to the punch bowl. Gently whisk the eggnog together until just combined and no large pockets of whites or cream remain (do not overwhisk or you’ll deflate the eggnog). Serve ideally in chilled punch cups and garnished with grated nutmeg.
You can vary the type of alchohol used as long as it is a darker and flavorful type of alcohol - ie never use clear liquors. You can also vary the quantity of alcohol to your preference. I would also avoid scotch as the smoky flavor doesn't necessarily compliment egg nog.
