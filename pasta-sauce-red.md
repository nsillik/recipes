# Pasta Sauce - Red

## Ingredients
- 1 can of the best crushed canned tomatoes you can find (San Marzano or similar)
- 1/4c butter
- 2 tbs olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, peeled, cut into quarters
- 1tbs of minced garlic (pre-minced in a jar is fine!)
- 2tsp oregano
- 1tsp salt
- 1tsp fresh ground pepper
- 1/2 red pepper flakes (or to taste)
- 2tbs tomato paste, optional

## Equipment
- A pot, large enough to hold all ingredients, with a lid
- An immersion blender (or regular blender, if you must)

## Steps

1. Put pot on stove, add onion, tomato, butter, olive oil (and optionally tomato paste for a slightly darker tasting sauce).
2. Cover pot and cook on medium for 30 minutes (or more depending on desired taste), covered. (It will splatter)
3. When onions are soft and sauce tastes good remove onions and add oregano, salt, pepper, pepper flakes, and garlic
4. Cook for about 5 minutes longer
5. Blend the sauce until desired consistency (this is optional, my wife doesn't like chunky sauce. If you do, then don't blend)
3. Return to pot cook for 5 more minutes
